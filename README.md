## Navigating the demo
Lightning Commerce is not currently production ready, but the demo gives you a good idea of what it's about and how it works. Opening the demo you will arrive on the *glass*, the customer facing website. Please note that this site, as well as the admin backoffice, are not yet mobile responsive.

You can switch from the glass to the backoffice via the link at the top right, and from the backoffice to the glass via the link under the site logo
